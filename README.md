# OneMap-Leaflet JS (Alpha Ver. 0.0.6)

This is an open-source project built on top of leaflet and togeojson for OneMap 2.0. 

This means you are able to freely invoke leaflet & related-projects' functions on the initialized "map" object.

In order to make OneMap more 2.0 interactive and data-driven, we will be strengthening OneMap-Leaflet JS codebase.

We invite you to give suggestions on how to evolve Project OneMap-Leaflet JS.
