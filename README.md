# OneMap-Leaflet JS (Alpha Ver. 0.1.8)

In order to make New OneMap interactive and data-driven, OneMap-Leaflet JS is born. We invite you to give suggestions on how to evolve Project OneMap-Leaflet JS.

This is an open-source project built on top of leaflet and togeojson for OneMap 2.0. 

This means you are able to freely invoke leaflet & related-projects' functions on the initialized "map" object.
